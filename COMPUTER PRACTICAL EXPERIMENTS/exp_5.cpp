Here are some tips for creating and operating spreadsheets in Excel: 
Cell referencing
Cell referencing is the basis for creating formulas and functions in Excel. By referencing cells in a formula, you can perform calculations based on the values in those cells.
Conditional formatting
This feature is used to find unique and duplicate values by formatting the cells.
Formula bar
This toolbar at the top of the Excel spreadsheet window can be used to enter or copy an existing formula into cells or charts.
Avoid repetitive formulas
Avoid repetitive calculations and calculate formulas only once.
Data validation
This feature is used to control what a user can enter in a cell of an Excel sheet. For example, you can restrict entries in a sheet, such as a date range or whole numbers only.
Hide and unhide columns and rows
The Excel Hide feature enables users to group the specific number of rows or columns and hides them temporarily.
Excel can also be used for data entry and storage of large amounts of data. The program allows you to create spreadsheets with multiple columns and rows, making it easy to organize and manage your data.
