creation and editing powerpoint slides using ms powerpoint










Here are some tips for creating and editing PowerPoint slides: 
Create a presentation
To create a presentation from scratch, select Blank Presentation. To use a prepared design, select a template.
Add a slide
In the slide thumbnail pane, click the slide that you want your new slide to follow. On the Home tab, click New Slide. In the New Slide dialog box, select the layout that you want for your new slide. Select Add Slide.
Get design ideas
To get design ideas for your slide, choose Design > Designer on the ribbon. Scroll through the suggestions in the Designer pane on the right side of the window. Click to select the design you want, or else close the window.
Add transitions and animations
Optionally, add transitions and animations to your slides.
Use the Designer
To create professional slide layouts, choose Design > Designer on the ribbon.
Use Normal view
Normal view is the editing mode where you'll work most frequently to create your slides. It displays slide thumbnails on the left, a large window showing the current slide, and a section below the current slide where you can type your speaker notes for that slide.
